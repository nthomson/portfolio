							<strong>Project: </strong>StackFrame Company Website<br />
							<strong>Date: </strong>December, 2009<br />
							<strong>My part: </strong>Most of my involvement in StackFrame was from a front-end 
							perspective. I coded a lot of the HTML and CSS and brought it in line with WC3 standards.
							I did, however, do a bit of back-end work in PHP.<br />

							<strong>Project: </strong>Stacklez Entertainment Site<br />
							<strong>Date: </strong>January, 2009<br />
							<strong>My part: </strong>
							Stacklez was a website I created while I was a senior in high school. It was a platform 
							for students to watch videos, play flash games, download commonly-used freeware, and talk
							in a student forum.
							I designed the layout, implemented the HTML and CSS, and wrote all of the server-side
							code myself. I also maintained the site and its associated forum. Stacklez was short-lived,
							and is no longer accessible.
