						<p>So this is the right content div, its about 1/2 the size of the left content div, sort of a column deal. I don't like 3 column layouts, so this is a two-column layout that has one half the size of the other.</p>
						<p>To the left we have a picture, what is a picture of? Who knows. Probably still Stacklez at this point. Either way, stuff. Anyways, that's the picture of what it is and its going to be and other things yeah. So things are things and hopefully they remain things. I'll probably put that fancy jquery stuff back in the portfolio eventually, now that the site looks decent, that is.</p>
